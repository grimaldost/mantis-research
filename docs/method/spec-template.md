# Spec — <feature/refactor name>

- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Status:** draft | ready (DoR passed) | in progress | done
- **Audience:** <who/what reads this>
- **Output artifact(s):** <paths>

## Context

Why this work, and what it builds on (link the relevant ADRs).

## Goal

One or two sentences: what this delivers.

## Gate commands

The exact commands that gate this work, named precisely (scope and excludes included) so
prompts and reviewers don't guess: e.g. `ruff check .`, `uv run pytest`, and the project's
type-check invocation. State *which* command, not "the linter".

## Non-goals

What this explicitly does NOT cover. Bounds scope so workers can't sprawl.

## Invariants touched

List every architectural invariant this work could affect (boundaries, locks,
immutability, schema contracts...). Each must already have an ADR; if not, write
the ADR first. *Naming these is a DoR requirement.*

## Enforcement status

| Invariant | Status | Gate/mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| <invariant key> | enforced \| review-only \| planned \| absent | <the gate, when enforced> |

*[keel](https://github.com/grimaldost/keel)'s `check-ready` gate (A10): no prose may claim an invariant is "enforced" / "guaranteed" unless its
row here is `enforced`. Checked only when this table is present; a claim inside backticks, or
one negated ("not enforced", "to be enforced later"), does not fire.*

## Concept → module map

| Concept introduced/changed | Module / file it lives in |
|---|---|
| <concept> | `path/to/module` |

*Every concept must map to a home. A concept with no module is a DoR failure.*

## Numbered sections

Each numbered section is a unit of work a single PR can cite. Keep them small and
single-concern.

### §1 <title>
What changes. **Acceptance criterion:** <the observable condition that means §1 is
done>.

### §2 <title>
What changes. **Acceptance criterion:** <...>.

*(Add sections as needed. Every section needs an acceptance criterion — this is
both a DoR check and each PR's exit gate.)*

*Ground factual claims with `path:line` anchors (optionally followed by a quoted line in
backticks) — keel's `check-ready` gate verifies they resolve and match. Cite a new ADR as
`docs/adr/NNNN-slug.md` using the next free number on your base, never a hardcoded guess.*

*Reuse notation: pin a reuse target as `**Model-on:** <backticked path>` or
`**Reuse:** <backticked path::symbol>`; keel's `check-ready` gate (A9) resolves the path, and the symbol
when given — so a spec cannot say "model-on / reuse X" without X actually existing.*

*Anchor ranges: a multi-line citation is `` `path:lo-hi` ``; keel's `check-ready` gate (A11) flags a range that
opens a bracket/brace/paren it does not close, so a citation cannot silently truncate a collection
literal mid-structure. Quote a literal complete or not at all.*

*Out-of-wave consumers: when a section MOVES, RENAMES, or RETYPES a symbol, or strips content from a
file, list every consumer beyond the import graph — scripts that regex/parse the file's TEXT
(docs-sync checks, doc anchors, tests reading it as data) and every READER of a retyped symbol — and
add each to that PR's file-list. (Not gated; the pre-mortem attacks it.)*

*Measurement / experiment specs: fill the optional `## Experiment design (Part B)` section below — the
eval/experiment DoR items (`definition-of-ready.md`, Part B) gate the axes it names.*

*Counting: a test-count tripwire counts pytest ITEMS (post-parametrize collection), not function
defs, and shows the parametrize expansion; enumerate code constructs by AST, never a bare text grep
(grep is a superset pre-filter only); pin both the UNIT and the AUTHORITY of any recount.*

## PR ↔ section manifest

| PR | Implements section | One concern? |
|---|---|---|
| PR01 | §1 | yes |
| PR02 | §2 | yes |

*Every section must be covered by exactly one PR, and every PR must cite exactly
one section. A many-to-one or uncovered section is a DoR failure.*

## Definition of Done (this spec)

Concrete, checkable conditions for the whole spec (beyond per-section criteria).

*Release-notes-in-wave: any section that adds public surface or changes behaviour carries its
CHANGELOG entry (and a migration-guide section, if consumer-facing) in the SAME wave — release-notes
completeness is a per-wave exit condition, not a terminal-audit cleanup; a consistency gate (e.g. a
docs-sync check) verifies cross-references, not completeness.*

## Experiment design (Part B)

*(Measurement / experiment specs only — delete this whole section for a code spec. The eval/experiment DoR
items (`definition-of-ready.md`, Part B) gate these axes; the reviewer certifies the design, the
keel's `check-ready` gate the certification. Fill the `<...>` placeholders; this is a `##` section, so it needs no
acceptance criterion and carries no anchors.)*

- **Estimand + unit of analysis:** <the effect measured, at what grain — per-item delta vs aggregate>
- **Reps / power & MEWD:** <N per arm; the minimum effect worth detecting; why N can detect it — a 1-rep delta is noise>
- **Blinding + held-constant factors:** <what is blinded; what is held equal across arms>
- **Correctness oracle (not "ran green"):** <what decides "correct", distinct from the run completing>
- **Measured-unit causal path:** <treatment end — the measured path READS what the treatment changes (not inert); measured-unit end — capabilities beyond the intended input enumerated, no side channel to the ground truth>
- **Enforcement of isolation invariants:** <each leakage/isolation invariant, and the buildable mechanism that enforces it, claimed by a numbered section/PR>
- **Pre-registered analysis plan:** <the analysis fixed before results are seen>

## Pre-mortem certification

*The externalized correctness pass (`pre-mortem-prompt.md`), signed by a fresh
reviewer who did NOT author this spec. keel's `check-ready` gate does not pass until the
verdict is `CERTIFIED` (ADR-0002). A freshly-scaffolded spec is, correctly, not Ready.*

- **Reviewer:**
- **Verdict:** not yet certified
- **Operator:** <required only when the Verdict is CONDITIONAL-CERTIFY — the named owner who accepts "ready modulo a named fix"; check-ready then passes with a WARN (B1)>
- **Date:**
- **Reviewed against:** <external dependency SHAs/versions reasoned against, if any>
- **Post-fold coherence:**
- **Failure modes considered & folded in:**

### Fold ledger

*Required when the certification claims a non-trivial fold (R1); a clean certify dozes: one row per folded finding so the post-fold delta is
reviewable. keel's `check-ready` gate (A12) holds each `artifact:line` to a resolving anchor — it verifies the
fold was recorded against a real line, not that it is correct (that is the reviewer's job). Leave the
header only (no data rows) and A12 dozes. The ledger must be the FIRST table under this `### Fold ledger`
heading — A12 reads only the first contiguous table, so a round-history / disposition table belongs in
its own section, not after the ledger here.*

| Finding | Target section | artifact:line | Confirmed |
|---|---|---|---|

---
*This template is structured so that most of the deterministic Definition-of-Ready
checks (`definition-of-ready.md`) pass by construction: numbered sections,
per-section acceptance criteria, the concept→module map, and the PR↔section
manifest are all required fields. The one field NOT satisfied by construction is the
pre-mortem certification — a non-author reviewer must sign it, which is the point
(ADR-0002).*
